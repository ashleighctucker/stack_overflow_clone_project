A few things to do:
  -have a delete a question link on our question page only if the question is your own
  -same with an edit link
  -page view for question / answers / comments (this will be all on one page ideally)
  -add a check in the front end route for asking new questions that makes sure they are logged in, if not, redirect to log in page
  -create question validators
  -create answer validators
